# odin-recipes
As the first project on theodinproject.com, it gives me the opportunity to practice and utilize all the HTML knowledge I have learned since day one including basic git commands and terminal usage. After I completed the project, I feel even more motivated to learn a lot more. I can't help but wonder what I would be able to do more with these pages once I am able to dive deep into theodinproject courseworks.

A couple of notes:
- I tried to avoid using copy and shotcut function and much as possible to build muscle memory.
- As the use of CSS has not been taught yet. There is not much I could do to brighten my homepage, so Japanese text was used instead. Another purpose is to see how other languages other than English would be displayed on the HTML page.
